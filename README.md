<h2>How your team is getting Agile development all wrong</h2>


<b>Rule #1 Lock It Down: Lock all requirements during Sprints</b>

Do you ever get the dreaded email regarding saying “By the way, we're also going to need you to do [insert new feature here]” at this week's demo on Friday? Yeah.. no big deal it's a small feature. Right? 

Now some ask, isn't that what Agile development is about? Being able to work on the fly and blow past the competition?

Nope. This is a common mistake people make trying to fit in additional features to the sprint/iteration. Joe Schmo the developer will now have to scramble to determine how to implement and integrate these new features for this sprint all before Friday. Oh and he will also have to coordinate with the DBAs to get the tables setup in the development environment. This means coordinating with additional team members to determine what additional tasks will be needed and going through management to get approval.   

Changes in mid sprint jeopardize work investmentt. Planning isn't free so having these additional stories increases the risk that we developers won't be able to deliver on time. 

<b>RULE #2 Time-Boxing</b>

Didn't get everything done, because we added that new story? What do we do? Ask the scrum master or product owner to extend our sprint duration? No! NoOooo! Nooooo!

Don't ever do that. People are habitual creatures. This goes back to proper planning and locking it down.... because the product owner is not always going to realize that by extending the sprint that your deliverables are going to be pushed back. Having known and consistent end dates helps us focus and test to ensure we are building our future stories on a solid foundation. This clarity is essential to a healthy development environment.  

Bottom line is that if we have to choose between failing the story or extending the sprint we should fail our story and pick it up later. This allows us to address what went wrong instead of ignoring it.  By doing this we can ensure we are getting consistent estimates in the future.


<b>RULE #3 Only the Team Estimates</b>

Hi Mr Scrum master,
 
I know we're supposed to deliver the product web service as well this sprint, but we haven't had a chance to test it at all. This requires that we configure a SOAP client to test. I wish Mark hadn't added those extra stories to this sprint....

Thanks,

Only the team members actually doing the work know the true obstacles that may come up. Maybe extra software installations or hardware will be needed to get this story done. Having the team members estimate these tasks allows them to clear up any questions about the scope and depth of each task which can reveal any incorrect assumptions they may have about the requirements. The product owner and the team members need to communicate and clarify each estimation from the start. 

Feedback is essential to ensure there are no misunderstandings down the line. Product owners don't have time to go through your long-winded technical specs. They need results, and we developers need feedback to guarantee that the user is happy with what we have delivered. Make feedback easy, and don't ignore what we get. You wouldn't add new stories to a broken foundation would you?
